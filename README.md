> **Q:** "How do you think the web will look like in 10 years?" **– [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)**

&nbsp;

> **A:** "This is a million :dollar: :moneybag: question!
Considering the phase at which web is growing, compared to what we had in 2005 and what we have now, I would guess that web
would grow out of browsers, handheld devices and reach to things that are connected.
It would be great to see things like:
A wall whose color can be controlled by CSS :wink:
A mirror in your bathroom which shows your daily rss feeds.
Web assembly handling bots.
A book when opened would show a 3D view of a website.
Neural networks, would connect to the web. (You think it types :wink:)
Weirdest of things we can think of might become a reality!"
